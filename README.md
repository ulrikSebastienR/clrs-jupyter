Working through CLRS (Introduction to Algorithms) in Python with Jupyter Notebook, Third Edition

This is a work in progress, but I thought it would be useful to journal my progress through this book.
I will work through all of the problems in the book in the following order:

| Order | Chapter    | Description                                      | Link                         |
